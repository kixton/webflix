webflix
=======

This was my first web application using a third party API.

I used The MovieDatabase API to pull in data about current, popular, and upcoming movies. I displayed movie posters, summaries, and ratings about each movie. I also embeded relevant movie trailers.

Technologies used include jQuery, Handlebars (for templating), Slick.js, HTML5, CSS3
